																			the game concept from there. What if players were trying to receive messages from space and in the end unknowingly were \
																			communicating with each other?<br>\
																			I started working on the game at the start of the jam by creating the 3D models with Blender for the game and then extrapolating the UI\
																			from how the models ended up looking. Then I moved to coding with C# and made the stars viewed through the periscope generate in a \
																			grid with random offsets and sizes. I ran into trouble getting the knobs in the radio UI to turn, but was able to figure it out \
																			by manipulating the sprite's angle directly and using the angle value to set desired radio stations.<br>\
																			I was also able to layer multiple text UI elements to give the effect of translating coded messages letter by letter. It took \
																			a good deal of trouble to get it working properly, but eventually I just forced it to work by simplifying some code I had \
																			previously overthought.",

																			more experience manipulating strings using .NET's <code>System.Text</code> namespace and methods in C#."
